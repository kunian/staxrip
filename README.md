# About

StaxRip is a powerful video/audio encoding GUI for Windows.  
It executes and controls console apps such as x265, mkvmerge, ffmpeg, etc. and uses scripting based frame servers, AviSynth+ and VapourSynth, for video processing.
Each project can also be extended by various events and settings.

***StaxRip is no One-Click Encoder!***  
StaxRip is capable of performing a wide variety of jobs for video/audio processing. To unleash its full power, users are required to know what they want to achieve and how to set up StaxRip to meet their needs.
If you are a first-time user, it is especially strongly recommended that you learn the basics referring to the documents and do some tests to understand how StaxRip works and what you can achieve with it. However, StaxRip also provides an 'Assistant' feature that will guide you through your jobs step by step so that you can start more easily and prevent mistakes.

There are a lot of resources in StaxRip-related communities. Users are strongly encouraged to visit those communities for help and more information.

# Prerequirements
- OS limitations: **Windows 7** users can use StaxRip only partly. The following tools are included and don't have official **Windows 7** support anymore. You in case you don't want to upgrade your system, you can replace these tools with an older, compatible, version, which should work, but of course with some limited usability:
    - MKVToolNix
        - Latest working version is reported to be `v64.0`. Last (complete) working StaxRip version is *StaxRip v2.10.0 (2021-10-06)* including *MKVToolNix v61.0*
        - Nevertheless `mkvtoolnix-64-bit-68.0.0-revision-001-g6a55c58d2` is reported to work, you can download it here: https://mkvtoolnix.download/windows/continuous/64-bit/68.0.0/
    - Python
        - Needed for VapourSynth. Last **Windows 7** compatible version was used in *StaxRip v2.25.0 (2023-08-02)*. As of now using VapourSynth R63 it could be possible to downgrade Python to `v3.8.*`that is **Windows 7** compatible, but requires experienced users.
             
     Alternatively you can download an old StaxRip release, but then you don't benefit from new functions and bug fixes.

- Some tools and filters might need a specific version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes. Due to the frequent changing and replacing of tools and filters, it is impossible to provide precise details about the right dependency. So if you get error messages to due to missing runtime files, we recommend to download and install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes All-in-One](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/).
